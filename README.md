# ArdArp

ArdArp is a MIDI arpeggiator for arduino. I is inspired by by raszhivins [*arpeggiator*](https://github.com/raszhivin/arpeggiator). But that did not work out of the box and i did not really get the code. So i wrote my own. Pretty simple. 

## TODO
 * MIDI in to define base note (instead of potetiometer)
 * sync/clock in 
 * pitch out

##  Features
* MIDI out
* GATE out
* tempo, gate length and swing control (potentiometer controlled)
* base note, arpeggio range (number of different notes), scale type (major, minor, 3rds, octave) and order of scale (up, down, up+down, shuffled, fully random; also potentiometer controlled)
